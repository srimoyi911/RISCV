  <summary>  Bad sitting posture detection and alerting system </summary> 
  Long sitting hours has caused a lot of health problems. This solution will constantly measure the distance between the chair and a persons head and back. Based on the measured distance, if it is found that the person is not sitting straight, then it will set the buzzer and the led high. A potentiometer is also added so that the user can define the timeout after which each measurement happens.
