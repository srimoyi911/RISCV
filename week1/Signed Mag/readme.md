#### Problem#1 
#### 10-19

10 = 0 01010 (sign magnitude)

-19 = 1 10011 (sign magnitude)
 19 = 1 01101 (2's complement)

###### Signed magnitude solution 
0 01010
1 10011
1 11101 - Ans
 
 

###### 1's complement solution 
0 01010  
1 01100  (1's complement of 19)
1 10110 - Ans 
(carry is 0 , so sum is a negative number and the magnitude is 1's complement of the sum)
1 01001 (final solution = -9)


###### 2's compliment solution 
0 01010
1 01101 (2's complement of 19)
1 10111 - Ans
(carry is 0, so sum is a negative number and the magnitude is 2's complement of the sum)
1 01001


#### Problem#2 
#### 20+30

20 = 0 010100 (sign magnitude)

30 = 0 011110 (sign magnitude)
30 = 0 100001 (1's complement)
30 = 0 100010 (2's complement)

###### Sign magnitude solution
0 010100 (sign magnitude)
0 011110 (sign magnitude)
0 110010 (Answer 50)

##### This problem doesn't need 1's complement and 2's complement solutions, as both are positive numbers


#### Problem#3
#### 36-12

36 = 0 100100 (sign magnitude)

-12 = 1 001100 (sign magnitude)

12 = 0 110011 (1's complement)
12 = 0 110100 (2's complement)
 
###### Sign magnitude solution
36 = 0 100100 (sign magnitude)
12 = 1 001100 (sign magnitude)

     1 110000

###### 1's complement solution
36 = 0 100100 (sign magnitude)
12 = 0 110011 (1's complement)

     1 010111 (carry is 1 , so answer is positive number, add carry to LSB of sum part to get final magnitude)
            1
       011000 (Ans 24)

###### 2's complement solution

36 = 0 100100 (sign magnitude)
12 = 0 110100 (2's complement)

     1 011000 (carry is 1 so answer is positive number, ignore the carry, sum part is the final magnitude)--Answer is +24
