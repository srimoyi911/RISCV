In this week we create a Custom RISC-V core that will run our application bare metal program that was created last week using inline assembly code.
Tasks completed 

1.  Take the tested and optimized inline assembly code from last week.
   [posture_detect.asm](https://github.com/srimoyi911/RISCV/blob/main/week4/posture_detect.asm)
2.  Created all.json file to generate the chipcron processor code
3.  Generated processor core and testbench
   
  
   

4.  Updated GPIO size and GPIO pin mappings in processor.v



5. Updated input and output width in testbench.v



6. Initialized qll input pins to 1 at the reset

   

7. Compiled and simulated the design using following command

  
  
8. Simulation result
